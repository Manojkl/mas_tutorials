    "In order to make informed decisions, a robot needs to possess as much knowledge about the world as possible; this includes background knowledge (which we call encyclopedic knowledge throughout this tutorial) as well as any knowledge that is acquired during online operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To equip our robots with such knowledge, we build our system around a rich knowledge base. For practical purpose, our knowledge base is split into three segments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An *ontology* for encyclopedic knowledge\n",
    "2. A *symbolic knowledge base* that facilitates planning and\n",
    "3. A *(weak) world model* for grounding symbolic knowledge to the real world\n",

Similarly, as in ROSPlan, we use [`mongodb_store`](https://github.com/strands-project/mongodb_store) as a world model representation. Our ontology, on the other hand, is heavily based on the [KnowRob ontology](http://www.knowrob.org) [2].\n",

    "\n",
    "Just as the KnowRob ontology, our domestic ontology is encoded in the [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/) (using the RDF syntax). We call our ontology [*the apartment ontology*](https://github.com/b-it-bots/mas_knowledge_base/blob/master/common/ontology/apartment.owl) since it's focused on representing knowledge about concepts that a robot encounters in an apartment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A formal treatment of ontologies and description logic is beyond the scope of this tutorial; for that, we direct the reader to [3]. We will instead consider a simple example to give an idea of what kind of knowledge we encode with the ontology. In particular, let us assume that we want to encode the following knowledge about a certain (unrealistically small) apartment:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is one room in the apartment - a home office\n",
    "* The home office has a desk whose height is $0.7m$\n",
    "* By default, my coffee mug is stored on the desk\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ontology, knowledge is encoded in two segments:\n",
    "* The *TBox*, which defines classes and properties that are of interest in a particular domain\n",
    "* The *ABox*, which contains class and property assertions\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent the knowledge from our example, we thus first need to define our TBox and then populate the ABox of the ontology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first encode the classes of interest in our domain. In particular, we will define:\n",
    "* two top level classes, namely `Object` and `Room`\n",
    "* `Furniture` and `Drinkware` classes, both of which are children of `Object`\n",
    "* a `Table` class that is a child of `Furniture` and a `WorkTable` class that is a child of `Table`\n",
    "* a `Mug` class that is a child of `Drinkware`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define these classes in OWL as follows:\n",

    "```\n",
    "<owl:Class rdf:about=\"apartment:Object\"/>\n",

    "* the default storing location of an object (in terms of furniture items) and\n",
    "* the height of an object\n",

    "<apartment:WorkTable rdf:about=\"MyDesk\"/>\n",
    "<apartment:Mug rdf:about=\"MyCoffeeMug\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "While symbolic knowledge is useful for abstract reasoning, robot decisions eventually have to be grounded to the real world. For example, if a robot needs to pick up `MyCoffeeMug`, knowing that `MyCoffeeMug` is on `MyDesk` is sufficient for creating a plan that involves going to `MyDesk` and then picking up `MyCoffeeMug` from it; however, in order to actually go to `MyDesk`, the robot needs to know where the desk actually is, and similarly, in order to pick up the mug from the table, it needs to know where the mug is actually positioned on the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we make use of ROSPlan in our architecture, we utilise `mongodb_store`$^{1}$ for storing such knowledge. `mongodb_store` is a ROS package that allows saving ROS messages into a MongoDB database and retrieving those back. Under the hood, ROS messages are converted into dictionaries that are then stored as MongoDB documents; documents can then be converted back into ROS messages upon retrieval. For our purposes, this means that we can for instance store our custom [object](https://github.com/b-it-bots/mas_perception_msgs/blob/kinetic/msg/Object.msg), [person](https://github.com/b-it-bots/mas_perception_msgs/blob/kinetic/msg/Person.msg), or [plane](https://github.com/b-it-bots/mas_perception_msgs/blob/kinetic/msg/Plane.msg) messages and retrieve them back whenever they are needed during execution. This can thus be thought of as our weak world model that, together with the previously encyclopedic knowledge and the symbolic knowledge base, allows us to program our robots so that they make decisions based on all available knowledge.\n",
